                "predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion\n" +
                "akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,\n" +
                "were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He\n" +
                "was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that\n" +
                "the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a\n" +

                "drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained\n" +
                "reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely\n" +
                "adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might\n" +
                "throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive\n" +
                "instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not\n" +

                "I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away\n" +

                "interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master\n" +
                "of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,\n" +

                "the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen\n" +
                "nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,\n" +
                "and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of\n" +
                "observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those\n" +
                "mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.\n" +
                "From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his\n" +

                "of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and\n" +
                "finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and\n" +
                "successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of\n" +
                "his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of\n" +

                "my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered\n" +
                "door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and\n" +
                "with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a\n" +
                "keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his\n" +
                "extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I\n" +
                "looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette\n" +
                "against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his\n" +
                "head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who\n" +
                "knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own\n" +
                "story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created\n" +
                "dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell\n" +
                "and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,\n" +
                "to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\n" +
                "me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\n" +
                "spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire\n" +
                "and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you have put\n" +

                "\n" +
                "“Seven!” I answered.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I\n" +
                "fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me\n" +
                "that you intended to go into harness.”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“Then, how do you know?”\n" +

                "“I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting\n" +
                "yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless\n" +
                "servant girl?”\n" +

                "“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly have\n" +
                "been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a\n" +
                "country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I\n" +
                "have changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\n" +
                "Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,\n" +
                "again, I fail to see how you work it out.”\n" +

                "“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside\n" +
                "of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is\n" +
                "scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by\n" +
                "someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in\n" +
                "order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double\n" +
                "deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a\n" +
                "particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As\n" +
                "to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of\n" +
                "iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right\n" +
                "forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where\n" +
                "he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not\n" +
                "pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\n" +
                "process of deduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked,\n" +
                "“the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I\n" +
                "could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your\n" +
                "reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I\n" +
                "believe that my eyes are as good as yours.”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\n" +
                "down into an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The\n" +
                "distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps\n" +
                "which lead up from the hall to this room.”\n" +
                "\n" +

                "\n" +

                "“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just\n" +
                "my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have\n" +
                "both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these\n" +
                "little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two\n" +
                "of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.” He threw\n" +
                "over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open\n" +
                "upon the table. “It came by the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”\n" +
                "\n" +

                "deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of\n" +
                "Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with\n" +
                "matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.\n" +
                "This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your\n" +

                "\n" +
                "“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine that it\n" +

                "\n" +
                "“I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has\n" +
                "data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\n" +
                "theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from\n" +
                "it?”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\n" +

                "\n" +
                "“The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked,\n" +
                "endeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could not\n" +
                "be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and\n" +

                "\n" +
                "“Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is not an English\n" +

                "\n" +

                "“The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’\n" +
                "which is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like\n" +
                "our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us\n" +
                "glance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume\n" +

                "that?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud\n" +

                "“A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he continued, glancing out of\n" +

                "of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from\n" +
                "Sherlock Holmes’ succinct description, but the locality appeared to be\n" +
                "less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a\n" +
                "quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of\n" +
                "shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a\n" +
                "scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a\n" +
                "nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and\n" +
                "down with cigars in their mouths.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the\n" +
                "house, “this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes\n" +
                "a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse\n" +
                "to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming\n" +
                "to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find\n" +
                "the photograph?”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“Where, indeed?”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet\n" +
                "size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows\n" +
                "that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two\n" +
                "attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that\n" +
                "she does not carry it about with her.”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“Where, then?”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am\n" +
                "inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like\n" +
                "to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else?\n" +
                "She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what\n" +
                "indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a\n" +
                "business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within\n" +
                "a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be\n" +
                "in her own house.”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“But it has twice been burgled.”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“Pshaw! They did not know how to look.”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“But how will you look?”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“I will not look.”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“What then?”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“I will get her to show me.”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“But she will refuse.”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her\n" +
                "carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the\n" +
                "curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to\n" +
                "the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at\n" +
                "the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a\n" +
                "copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with\n" +
                "the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by\n" +
                "the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the\n" +
                "scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was\n" +
                "struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage,\n" +
                "was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who\n" +
                "struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes\n" +
                "dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her,\n" +
                "he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely\n" +
                "down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one\n" +
                "direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better\n" +
                "dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,\n" +
                "crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene\n" +
                "Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she\n" +
                "stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of\n" +
                "the hall, looking back into the street.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“Is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“He is dead,” cried several voices.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“No, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another. “But he’ll be gone\n" +
                "before you can get him to hospital.”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“He’s a brave fellow,” said a woman. “They would have had the lady’s\n" +
                "purse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. They were a gang, and a\n" +
                "rough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?”\n" +

                "“Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa.\n" +

                "\n" +
                "Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the\n" +
                "principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by\n" +
                "the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn,\n" +
                "so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know\n" +
                "whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he\n" +
                "was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of\n" +
                "myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I\n" +
                "was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon\n" +
                "the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes\n" +
                "to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened\n" +
                "my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I\n" +
                "thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from\n" +
                "injuring another.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who\n" +
                "is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At\n" +
                "the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my\n" +
                "rocket into the room with a cry of “Fire!” The word was no sooner out\n" +
                "of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and\n" +
                "ill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids—joined in a general shriek of\n" +
                "“Fire!” Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the\n" +
                "open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later\n" +
                "the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false\n" +
                "alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner\n" +
                "of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm\n" +
                "in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly\n" +
                "and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the\n" +
                "quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“You did it very nicely, Doctor,” he remarked. “Nothing could have been\n" +
                "better. It is all right.”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“You have the photograph?”\n" +
                "\n" +

                "\n" +

                "\n" +
                "“I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing. “The matter was\n" +
                "perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was\n" +
                "an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.”\n" +
                "\n" +

                "“Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the\n" +
                "palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my\n" +
                "face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“That also I could fathom.”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could\n" +
                "she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I\n" +
                "suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to\n" +
                "see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were\n" +
                "compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“How did that help you?”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire,\n" +
                "her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It\n" +
                "is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken\n" +
                "advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it\n" +
                "was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married\n" +
                "woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.\n" +
                "Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house\n" +
                "more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to\n" +
                "secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting\n" +
                "were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The\n" +
                "photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right\n" +
                "bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as\n" +
                "she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she\n" +
                "replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have\n" +
                "not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the\n" +
                "house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once;\n" +
                "but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it\n" +
                "seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.”\n" +
